# Papers-and-research

I have written several reports during my studies which I am reluctant keeping just for myself since they contain useful insights that could be of interest and beneficial to someone digging into the same topics.

BE AWARE that the reports are in pdf format thus you must DOWNLOAD them!

Hope you will find some of the below papers worth reading ;)

### Continuous Density Hidden Markov model 
 The aim of this report is to implement the Baum –Welch training of the continuous-density hidden Markov model parameters.
 The computational process will proceed through three main steps, namely the estimation of the continuous output probability densities, the evaluation of the observation
 sequence probability and the training of the model parameters by adjusting the state transition matrix, the means and variances values. Moreover, the report will contain
 the state topology and will illustrate the probability density functions for each state of the model before and after the first iteration.

### Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Recognition
This paper addresses the subject of object recognition and covers the basic concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks. Indeed several pre-trained CNN were taken into consideration in order to analyze both qualitatively and quantitatively their performance and accuracy. 
It was also implemented a code that computed the confusion matrix of the predicted classes for each CNN.

### Visual Search Assignment
The report presents the results of a Matlab visual search program, which evaluates the implementation of different approaches for images similarity estimation and different distance measures.

### Speech processing and recognition
The main purpose of this paper is to use the speech processing tools provided by MATLAB language in order to extract important features from  the audio signal representation and to synthesize the original sound by using the source-filter model of speech production

### Pattern Recognition
The aim of this report is to apply the basic probability relationships to equiprobable distributed classes in order to estimate the Bayesian error of the optimal decision rule and the system error for the training and the test data sets. Moreover, the report will contain the analysis and sketch of class distributions having the mean μi of class ωi and covariance matrix Σ.

### Image warping techniques
This paper addresses the subject of digital image warping and covers the basic concepts of image warping techniques such as geometric transformations, 
digital image mapping, image reconstruction and antialiasing.
